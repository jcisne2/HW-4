# HW-4
implementing everything I've learned from week 1 until now this assignment challenged me in so many ways
Html i had to add a few buttons with classes and id's 
in the css I went can created a root in which i added many things and being able to call those using the var feature was nice 
the script was the most difficult task as this is where I got caught up on so many thing, but three i want to highlight is the timer, next question, and highscore.
wit the timer i had a difficult time adding the feature that subtracts time for every wrong answer with enough searching for a solution i found how to do it
getting the next question to appear was also a difficult task and resetting the page to 'hide' previous buttons
highscore submission was interesting as i decided to go with the best time as the measurement because getting the wrong answers effects your score directly
